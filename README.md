# LaylineCalc
No Man's Sky layline calculator made by Bjorn the Void Trader and Soup Cat. Use this to find 3-star deposits (such as runaway mould).


Included here are:

- build folder with the .exe file inside - remember to make a shortcut instead of moving the file
- original .py file in case you want to see the code or you're just on mac (i can't make a .dmg)
- an icon for the app
- fonts used in the app
